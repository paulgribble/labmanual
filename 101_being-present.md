# Being Present

We are an in-person lab.

The expectation is that everyone comes on campus regularly (e.g. on weekdays, during regular business hours).

We do not operate remotely, we are an in-person lab.

Being present in the lab counts for a lot. You will bump into people, and conversations will start, you will talk about your work, their work, a paper you read, a talk you saw. Ideas will occur. Spontaneous interactions like this are a big part of science and of any kind of creative work. The more you're present, and interactive, the more this will happen. Be present as much as possible. Reading papers? Read them here. Writing a paper? Write it here. Grading assignments? Grade them here.

The other phenomenon that being present in the lab helps facilitate is a rapid feedback loop for problem-solving. When you run into a problem, whether it's a software/coding issue, or an equipment issue, a sticking point as you're writing a manuscript, or even a conceptual roadblock, something you need feedback on, if you are physically here, you can walk over to a lab-mate, or me, and ask. Maybe we have the answer, maybe not, at least we can point you in a fruitful direction. Often this means problems can be solved within seconds/minutes. If we are all remote, it could be hours or even days (or even weeks). This is not the way our lab operates.

Work in the lab. Make it a general habit to come to the lab every weekday and do the majority of your work in the lab. Of course there may be exceptions, e.g. times when you would like to work at home, e.g. on writing, but even then, doing it in the lab can be very beneficial, as there are others around to get feedback from, immediately.

As your thesis supervisor I am best able to mentor you in person.
