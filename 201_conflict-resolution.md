# Conflict Resolution

It's really important to me that everyone in the lab can get along and work together in a mutually respectful and intellectually generous environment. Working together with people who have different personalities, a wide range of ages, and a diversity of life experience can be challenging at times, for sure. It's something we all have to work together to support.

If you have concerns about how a fellow lab member is behaving interpersonally, please first try your best to resolve the situation with each other, if appropriate. If you still have concerns please communicate them to me. I will listen, without judgment, and do my best to support you. If needed, I will take steps to address a situation that is causing interpersonal conflict. Ultimately though it is up to each of us to find a way to work together.
