# Research Ethics

All experiments must have approval from Western's Research Ethics Board (REB). Each of you is responsible for obtaining an REB approval for your study/studies. You are responsible for keeping detailed records of each research participant including receipts for payment of subject fees. Getting a study approved can sometimes take several months so start early. It's better to submit early and submit revisions than wait until your study design is finalized.
