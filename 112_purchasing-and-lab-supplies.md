# Purchasing & Lab Supplies

All purchases using research accounts must comply with both University and Tri-Council rules about eligible expenses. If there is any doubt, ask me. The simple rule is, all purchases must be directly related to research activities.

You can use your own money to buy things, and then submit an expense report afterwards to get reimbursed (it typically takes 7–10 days to see the money in your account).

It is also possible to submit an advance request (they are called travel advances) and the university will deposit cash into your account. You must then reconcile the expenses incurred against the advance by submitting an expense report once the money is spent.

If the vendor supports it you can also use one of the lab's speed-codes to directly charge one of our research grants. Ask me for the appropriate speedcode to use.
