# Scientific Misconduct

The Office of Research Integrity at the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services provides a [definition of research misconduct](https://ori.hhs.gov/definition-misconduct):

> Research misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results.
> 
> (a) Fabrication is making up data or results and recording or reporting them.
> 
> (b) Falsification is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record.
>
> (c) Plagiarism is the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit.
> 
> (d) Research misconduct does not include honest error or differences of opinion.

Scientific misconduct of any kind will not be tolerated in our lab. We are in a priviledged position, to spend our time working towards understanding how the world works. We have a responsibility to conduct ourselves with integrity and transparency.

We will treat scientific misconduct of any kind very seriously, and you will face severe consequences. Do not do it.


## Responsible use of Research Funds

Research funds are to be used only for the direct costs of research. Research funds may not be used for personal expenses. 

NSERC publishes a [Use of Grant Funds](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Professors-Professeurs/FinancialAdminGuide-guideAdminFinancier/FundsUse-UtilisationSubventions_eng.asp) document which goes into some detail about what are eligible expenses against grant funds, and what expenditures are not eligible. If you are unsure about what may or may not be an eligible expense, please ask me.

Misuse of research grant funds is a very serious offence. You will face severe consequences. Do not do it.
