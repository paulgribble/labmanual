# Communication

We use the lab Slack [sensorimotor.slack.com](sensorimotor.slack.com) for communication within the lab and with other members of the Sensorimotor Superlab (the Gribble, Pruszynski, and Diedrichsen labs).

## After-hours communication

If I Slack or email you on nights/weekends/holidays, I do not expect you to respond straight away. Rather, as a parent & someone who loves the freedom academia gives me to set my own schedule, I work whenever I can/need/want to. And so can you.
