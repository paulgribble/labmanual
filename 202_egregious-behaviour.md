# Egregious Behaviour

I expect us all, including myself, to be respectful of each other. We do not tolerate harassment, belittlement, bullying, or discrimination of any kind. Being respectful means many things, but it includes: not gossiping about each other's private lives; respecting confidentiality in official matters with the University; being mindful of how other people might interpret jokes differently than yourself; behaving in a professional manner in the lab, on campus, and when dealing with the public in your capacity as a scientist (e.g. experimental participants, patients, visiting speakers, etc). If you have concerns about harassment, unprofessional behaviour, in the context of our lab or any other situation on campus, please come to me straight away to communicate your concerns.
