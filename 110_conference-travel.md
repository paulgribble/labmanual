# Conference Travel

Travel to conferences is dependent from year to year on our lab budget. Generally our model is that to attend a conference, your research project should be sufficiently developed such that it makes sense to present a poster or give a talk. This is something that we will decide together.

We generally do no submit "prospective" abstracts in which we promise either data or findings that we do not already have obtained at the time of submitting the abstract. 

**By the abstract submission deadline, we must have enough data collected, and enough analysis complete, that we are very confident in the results and findings.**

This can be challenging because often deadlines for abstracts are many months in advance of the conference itself. That said, learning to work backward from firm deadlines is an essential skill, not just in grad school, but in any career. Conference deadlines provide a concrete target to plan around, and can be a useful forcing function for making steady progress on a project. Treating these dates seriously, and building in buffer time for the unexpected, is good practice for navigating the many real-world deadlines you will encounter throughout your professional life.

We often attend [SFN](https://www.sfn.org/meetings) and [NCM](https://ncm-society.org/) each year. If there is another meeting or meetings that you would like to attend, that is a possibility, budget permitting. Typically trainees attend 1 major meeting per year.

## Conference Abstracts

**IMPORTANT**: You will need to show me your draft abstracts, posters, etc, well in advance of the conference deadline, as typically we will require several edits before they are ready to submit. I would like to see your final draft **at least one week before the conference deadline** so that we have a chance to edit it together.

## Conference Talks

For talks, you should have a complete talk prepared at least two weeks before the meeting (if not more), so that you can give one or more practice talks to our lab group, and make adjustments in advance of the meeting. Typically we aim for at least three practice talks.
