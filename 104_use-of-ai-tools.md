# Use of AI Tools in Your Scientific Work

Artificial intelligence tools such as large language models have become widely available and can serve useful functions similar to spell checkers, grammar checkers, and even evaluate writing style. Using these tools to polish prose, catch typographical errors, or improve the clarity of sentences *you have already written* is generally acceptable.

However, in our lab it is not appropriate to use AI tools to perform the intellectual work that lies at the heart of our work as scientists. This includes synthesizing ideas from the literature, generating research questions or hypotheses, critically evaluating papers, drafting the content of a research paper, or grant proposal, or formulating arguments and interpretations. These kinds of tasks are precisely what you are here to learn to do, as scientists in training.

The purpose of graduate and postdoctoral training is to develop your capacity for independent scientific thought. That capacity grows through intellectual struggle, through the slow and sometimes frustrating process of reading deeply, thinking carefully, writing, and rewriting, and in doing so refining your ideas. Your supervisor and your other mentors play a crucial role in guiding your intellectual development, through discussion and critique.

If you outsource your mental work to an AI tool, you deprive yourself of the experiences that build expertise and intellectual maturity. Science advances because human minds engage seriously with hard problems. Our aim in this lab is to cultivate that engagement, not to shortcut it.

It is also important to consider that privacy and intellectual property safeguards differ significantly between commercial AI tools, and also between free, paid, and enterprise versions. When you input your research ideas, data, or draft text into AI tools you may be disclosing sensitive information to third parties. It may not be possible to determine how that information will be stored, used, or protected.
