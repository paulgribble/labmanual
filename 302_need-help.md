The Student Health Services office has a variety of services including medical appointments with Physicians, Birth Control information, Counselling & Psychiatry, Allergy injections & immunization (including annual flu shots), sexually transmitted disease testing, wellness activities (meditation, tai chi, yoga), Sports-Medicine Clinic (the [Fowler-Kennedy Sports Medicine Clinic](http://www.fowlerkennedy.com/), which provides sports-medicine appointments with Physicians & Surgeons, as well as Physiotherapy) and Crisis Intervention.
